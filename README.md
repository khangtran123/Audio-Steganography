# Audio-Steganography
This will be my Final Year Project that focuses on steganography in the form of audio files that includes using either MP3 or WAV files as the carriers. This GUI application will allow any user to easily embed data files of their choice into an audio file that can be covertly transmitted to another third-party user.
